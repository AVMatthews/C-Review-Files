# C-Review-Files


Note:

The makefile included in this repo is set up to work with the main.c and linked_list.c files. You'll have to update the makefile to compile the linked_list_withremove.c file.


Play around with the files.

     ->Try updating the makefile to work with the with remove linked list
     
     ->Try making the makefile more sophisticated by putting the flags in variables or seperating the compilation of the linked_list and main.
     
     ->Try implementing remove for yourself. (Look at our implementation as little as possible)
     
     ->Think of other linked list functions you could add.
     
     ->Try turning it into a doubly linked list.
     
     ->etc.
